# Enphase Binding

This is the binding for the [Enphase](https://enphase.com/) Envoy Solar Panel gateway.
The binding uses the local API of the Envoy gateway.
Some calls can be made without authentication and some use a user name and password.
The default user name is `envoy` and the default password is the last 6 numbers of the serial number.
The Envoy gateway updates the data every 5 minutes.
Therefore using a refresh rate shorter doesn't provide more information.

## Supported Things

The follow things are supported:

* `envoy` The Envoy gateway thing, which is a bridge thing.
* `inverter` A Enphase micro inverter connected to a solar panel.
* `relay`  A Enphase relay.

Not all Envoy gateways support all channels and things.
Therefore some data on inverters and the relay may not be available.
The binding auto detects which data is available and will report this in the log on initialization of the gateway bridge.

## Discovery

The binding can discover Envoy gateways, micro inverters and relays.

## Thing Configuration

The Envoy gateway thing `envoy` has the following configuration options:

| parameter    | required | description                                                                                                 |
|--------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| serialNumber | yes      | The serial number of the Envoy gateway which can be found on the gateway                                    |
| hostname     | no       | The host name/ip address of the Envoy gateway. Leave empty to auto detect                                   |
| username     | no       | The user name to the Envoy gateway. Leave empty when using the default user name                            |
| password     | no       | The password to the Envoy gateway. Leave empty when using the default password                              |
| refresh      | no       | Period between data updates. The default is the same 5 minutes the data is actual refreshed on the Envoy    |

The micro inverter `inverter` and `relay` things have only 1 parameter:

| parameter    | required | description                       |
|--------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| serialNumber | yes      | The serial number of the inverter |

## Channels

The `envoy` thing has can show both production as well as consumption data.
There are channel groups for `production` and `consumption` data.
The `consumption` data is only available if the gateway reports this.
A example of a production channel name is: `production#wattsNow`.

| channel            | type          | description                           |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| wattHoursToday     | Number:Energy | Watt hours produced today             |
| wattHoursSevenDays | Number:Energy | Watt hours produced the last 7 days   |
| wattHoursLifetime  | Number:Energy | Watt hours produced over the lifetime |
| wattsNow           | Number:Power  | Latest watts produced                 |

The `inverter` thing has the following channels:

| channel         | type         | description                          |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| lastReportWatts | Number:Power | Last reported power delivery         |
| maxReportWatts  | Number:Power | Maximum reported power               |
| lastReportDate  | DateTime     | Date of last reported power delivery |

The following channels are only available if supported by the Envoy gateway:

The `relay` thing has the following channels:

| channel         | type         | description                                            |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| relay           | Contact      | Status of the relay.                                   |
| line1Connected  | Contact      | If power line 1 is connected. If closed it's connected |
| line2Connected  | Contact      | If power line 2 is connected. If closed it's connected |
| line2Connected  | Contact      | If power line 3 is connected. If closed it's connected |

The `inverter` and `relay` have the following additional advanced channels:

| channel         | type               | description                          |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| producing       | Switch (Read Only) | If the device is producing           |
| communicating   | Switch (Read Only) | If the device is communicating       |
| provisioned     | Switch (Read Only) | If the device is provisioned         |
| operating       | Switch (Read Only) | If the device is operating           |
