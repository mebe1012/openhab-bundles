# RadioThermostat Binding

![RadioThermostat logo](doc/index.jpg)

This binding connects RadioThermostat/3M Filtrete models CT30, CT50/3M50, CT80, etc. with built-in Wi-Fi module to openHAB.

The binding retrieves and periodically updates all basic system information from the thermostat.
The main thermostat functions such as thermostat mode, fan mode, temperature set point and hold mode can be controlled.
System run-time information and humidity readings are polled less frequently and can be disabled completely if not desired.
Humidity information is available only when using a CT80 thermostat and I have noticed that the humidity reported is very inaccurate.

The main caveat for using this binding is to keep in mind that the web server in the thermostat is very slow.
Do not over load it with excessive amounts of simultaneous commands.
When changing the thermostat mode, the current temperature set point is cleared and a refresh of the thermostat data is done to get the new mode's set point.
Since retrieving the thermostat's data is the slowest operation, it will take several seconds after changing the mode before the new set point is displayed.
The 'Program Mode' command is untested and according to the published API is only available on a CT80 Rev B.

## Supported Things

There is exactly one supported thing type, which represents the thermostat.
It has the `rtherm` id.
Multiple Things can be added if more than one thermostat is to be controlled.

## Discovery

Auto-discovery is supported if the thermostat can be located on the local network using SSDP.
Otherwise the thing must be manually added.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has no configuration options, all configuration is done at Thing level.

## Thing Configuration

The thing has a few configuration parameters:

|    Parameter    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| setpointMode    | Controls temporary or absolute setpoint mode. In "temporary" mode the thermostat will temporarily maintain the given setpoint, returning to its program after a time. In "absolute" mode the thermostat will ignore its program maintaining the given setpoint. |
| clockSync       | Flag to enable the binding to sync the internal clock on the thermostat to match the openHAB host's system clock. Use if the thermostat is not setup to connect to the manufacturer's cloud server. Sync occurs at binding startup and every hour thereafter.   |
