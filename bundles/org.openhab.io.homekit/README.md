# HomeKit Add-on

This is an add-on that exposes your openHAB system as a bridge over the HomeKit protocol.

Using this add-on, you will be able to control your openHAB system using Apple's Siri, or any of a number of HomeKit enabled iOS apps.
In order to do so, you will need to make some configuration changes.
HomeKit organizes your home into "accessories" that are made up of a number of "characteristics".
Some accessory types require a specific set of characteristics.

HomeKit integration supports following accessory types:

- Switchable
- Outlet
- Lighting (simple, dimmable, color)
- Fan
- Thermostat
- Heater / Cooler
- Lock
- Security System
- Garage Door Opener
- Motorized Door
- Motorized Window
- Window Covering/Blinds
- Valve
- Air Quality Sensor
- Contact Sensor
- Leak Sensor
- Motion Sensor
- Occupancy Sensor
- Smoke Sensor
- Temperature Sensor
- Humidity Sensor
- Light Sensor
- Carbon Dioxide Sensor
- Carbon Monoxide Sensor

Add metadata to more item or fine-tune your configuration using further settings


## Global Configuration

You can define HomeKit settings either via mainUI or via `$OPENHAB_CONF/services/homekit.cfg`.
HomeKit works with default settings, but we recommend changing the pin for the bridge.
This will be used in iOS when pairing without QR Code. The pin code is in the form "###-##-###".
Requirements beyond this are not clear, and Apple enforces limitations on eligible pins within iOS.
At the very least, you cannot use repeating (111-11-111) or sequential (123-45-678) pin codes.

Other settings, such as using Fahrenheit temperatures, customizing the thermostat heat/cool/auto modes, and specifying the interface to advertise the HomeKit bridge are also illustrated in the following sample:

```
org.openhab.homekit:port=9123
org.openhab.homekit:pin=031-45-154
org.openhab.homekit:useFahrenheitTemperature=true
org.openhab.homekit:thermostatTargetModeCool=CoolOn
org.openhab.homekit:thermostatTargetModeHeat=HeatOn
org.openhab.homekit:thermostatTargetModeAuto=Auto
org.openhab.homekit:thermostatTargetModeOff=Off
org.openhab.homekit:networkInterface=192.168.0.6
org.openhab.homekit:useOHmDNS=false
org.openhab.homekit:blockUserDeletion=false
org.openhab.homekit:name=openHAB
```

| useOHmDNS                | mDNS service is used to advertise openHAB as HomeKit bridge in the network so that HomeKit clients can find it. openHAB has already mDNS service running. This option defines whether the mDNS service of openHAB or a separate service should be used.   | false  |
| blockUserDeletion        | Blocks HomeKit user deletion in openHAB and as result unpairing of devices. If you experience an issue with accessories becoming non-responsive after some time, try to enable this setting. You can also enable this setting if your HomeKit setup is done and you will not re-pair ios devices.                                              | false         |
| pin                      | Pin code used for pairing with iOS devices. Apparently, pin codes are provided by Apple and represent specific device types, so they cannot be chosen freely. The pin code 031-45-154 is used in sample applications and known to work. | 031-45-154    |

| name                     | Name under which this HomeKit bridge is announced on the network. This is also the name displayed on the iOS device when searching for available bridges.                                                                               | openHAB       |

## Item Configuration

After setting the global configuration, you will need to tag your [openHAB items](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/items.html) for HomeKit with accessory type.
For our purposes, you may consider HomeKit accessories to be of two types: simple and complex.

A simple accessory will be mapped to a single openHAB item, e.g. HomeKit lighting can represent an openHAB Switch, Dimmer, or Color item.
A complex accessory will be made up of multiple openHAB items, e.g. HomeKit Thermostat can be composed of mode, and current & target temperature.
Complex accessories require a tag on a Group Item indicating the accessory type, as well as tags on the items it composes.

A HomeKit accessory has mandatory and optional characteristics (listed below in the table).
The mapping between openHAB items and HomeKit accessory and characteristics is done by means of [metadata](https://www.openhab.org/docs/concepts/items.html#item-metadata)

If the first word of the item name match the room name in home app, home app will hide it. 
E.g. item with the name "Kitchen Light" will be shown in "Kitchen" room as "Light". This is recommended naming convention for HomeKit items and rooms.

### UI based Configuration

In order to add metadata to an item:

- select desired item in mainUI
- click on "Add Metadata"
  
  ![item_add_metadata_button.png](doc/item_add_metadata_button.png)
  
- select "Apple HomeKit" namespace
  
  ![select_homekit_namespace.png](doc/select_homekit_namespace.png)
  
- click on "HomeKit Accessory/Characteristic"
  
  ![add_homekit_tag.png](doc/add_homekit_tag.png)

- select required HomeKit accessory type or characteristic
  
  ![select_homekit_accessory_type.png](doc/select_homekit_accessory_type.png)
  
- click on "Save"


### Textual configuration

```xtend
Switch leaksensor_metadata  "Leak Sensor"           {homekit="LeakSensor"}
```

You can link one openHAB item to one or more HomeKit accessory, e.g.

```xtend
Switch occupancy_and_motion_sensor       "Occupancy and Motion Sensor Tag"  {homekit="OccupancySensor,MotionSensor"}
```

The tag can be:

- full qualified: i.e. with accessory type and characteristic, e.g. "LeakSensor.LeakDetectedState"
- shorthand version: with only either accessory type or characteristic, e.g. "LeakSensor", "LeakDetectedState".

if shorthand version has only accessory type, then HomeKit will automatically link *all* mandatory characteristics of this accessory type to the openHAB item.
e.g. HomeKit window covering has 3 mandatory characteristics: CurrentPosition, TargetPosition, PositionState.
Following are equal configuration:

```xtend
Rollershutter 	window_covering 	"Window Rollershutter"  	{homekit="WindowCovering"}
Rollershutter 	window_covering 	"Window Rollershutter"  	{homekit="WindowCovering, WindowCovering.CurrentPosition, WindowCovering.TargetPosition, WindowCovering.PositionState"}
```

If the shorthand version has only a characteristic then it must be a part of a group which has a HomeKit accessory type.
You can use openHAB group to define complex accessories. The group item must indicate the HomeKit accessory type,
e.g. LeakSensor definition

```xtend
Group  gLeakSensor                      "Leak Sensor Group"                                              {homekit="LeakSensor"}
Switch leaksensor                       "Leak Sensor"                           (gLeakSensor)            {homekit="LeakSensor.LeakDetectedState"}
Switch leaksensor_battery               "Leak Sensor Battery"                   (gLeakSensor)            {homekit="LeakSensor.BatteryLowStatus"}
```

You can use openHAB group to manage state of multiple items. (see [Group items](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/items.html#derive-group-state-from-member-items))
In this case, you can assign HomeKit accessory type to the group and to the group items
Following example defines 3 HomeKit accessories of type Lighting:

- "Light 1" and "Light 2" as independent lights
- "Light Group" that controls "Light 1" and "Light 2" as group

```xtend
Group:Switch:OR(ON,OFF) gLight "Light Group" {homekit="Lighting"}
Switch light1 "Light 1" (gLight) {homekit="Lighting.OnState"}
Switch light2 "Light 2" (gLight) {homekit="Lighting.OnState"}
```


## Accessory Configuration Details

This section provides examples widely used accessory types. 
For complete list of supported accessory types and characteristics please see section [Supported accessory type](#Supported accessory type)

### Dimmers

The way HomeKit handles dimmer devices can be different to the actual dimmers' way of working.
HomeKit home app sends following commands/update:

- On brightness change home app sends "ON" event along with target brightness, e.g. "Brightness = 50%" + "State = ON".
- On "ON" event home app sends "ON" along with brightness 100%, i.e. "Brightness = 100%" + "State = ON"
- On "OFF" event home app sends "OFF" without brightness information.

However, some dimmer devices for example do not expect brightness on "ON" event, some others do not expect "ON" upon brightness change.
In order to support different devices HomeKit integration can filter some events. Which events should be filtered is defined via dimmerMode configuration.

```xtend
Dimmer dimmer_light	"Dimmer Light" 	 {homekit="Lighting, Lighting.Brightness" [dimmerMode="<mode>"]}
```

Following modes are supported:

- "normal" - no filtering. The commands will be sent to device as received from HomeKit. This is default mode.
- "filterOn" - ON events are filtered out. only OFF events and brightness information are sent
- "filterBrightness100" - only Brightness=100% is filtered out. everything else sent unchanged. This allows custom logic for soft launch in devices.
- "filterOnExceptBrightness100"  - ON events are filtered out in all cases except of brightness = 100%.

Examples:

 ```xtend
 Dimmer dimmer_light_1	"Dimmer Light 1" 	 {homekit="Lighting, Lighting.Brightness" [dimmerMode="filterOn"]}
 Dimmer dimmer_light_2	"Dimmer Light 2" 	 {homekit="Lighting, Lighting.Brightness" [dimmerMode="filterBrightness100"]}
 Dimmer dimmer_light_3	"Dimmer Light 3" 	 {homekit="Lighting, Lighting.Brightness" [dimmerMode="filterOnExceptBrightness100"]}
 ```

### Windows Covering (Blinds) / Window / Door

HomeKit Windows Covering, Window and Door accessory types have following mandatory characteristics:

- CurrentPosition (0-100% of current window covering position)
- TargetPosition (0-100% of target position)
- PositionState (DECREASING,INCREASING or STOPPED as state). If no state provided, HomeKit will send STOPPED

These characteristics can be mapped to a single openHAB rollershutter item. In such case currentPosition will always equal target position, means if you request to close a blind/window/door, HomeKit will immediately report that the blind/window/door is closed.
As discussed above, one can use full or shorthand definition. Following two definitions are equal:

```xtend
Rollershutter 	window 		            "Window"  	                {homekit = "Window"}
Rollershutter 	door		            "Door"  	                {homekit = "Door"}
Rollershutter   window_covering         "Window Rollershutter"      {homekit = "WindowCovering"}
Rollershutter 	window_covering_long 	"Window Rollershutter long" {homekit = "WindowCovering, WindowCovering.CurrentPosition, WindowCovering.TargetPosition, WindowCovering.PositionState"}
 ```

openHAB Rollershutter is defined by default as:

- OPEN if position is 0%,
- CLOSED if position is 100%.

In contrast, HomeKit window covering/door/window have inverted mapping

- OPEN if position 100%
- CLOSED if position is 0%

Therefore, HomeKit integration inverts by default the values between openHAB and HomeKit, e.g. if openHAB current position is 30% then it will send 70% to HomeKit app.
In case you need to disable this logic you can do it with configuration parameter inverted="false", e.g.

```xtend
Rollershutter window_covering "Window Rollershutter" {homekit = "WindowCovering"  [inverted="false"]}
Rollershutter window		   "Window"  	         {homekit = "Window" [inverted="false"]}
Rollershutter door		       "Door"  	         {homekit = "Door" [inverted="false"]}

 ```

Window covering can have a number of optional characteristics like horizontal & vertical tilt, obstruction status and hold position trigger.
If your blind supports tilt, and you want to control tilt via HomeKit you need to define blind as a group.
e.g.

```xtend
Group           gBlind    			    "Blind with tilt"       						{homekit = "WindowCovering"}
Rollershutter   window_covering         "Blind"                         (gBlind)        {homekit = "WindowCovering"}
Dimmer          window_covering_htilt   "Blind horizontal tilt"         (gBlind)        {homekit = "WindowCovering.CurrentHorizontalTiltAngle, WindowCovering.TargetHorizontalTiltAngle"}
Dimmer          window_covering_vtilt   "Blind vertical tilt"           (gBlind)        {homekit = "WindowCovering.CurrentVerticalTiltAngle, WindowCovering.TargetVerticalTiltAngle"}
 ```

Current and Target Position characteristics can be linked to Rollershutter but also to Number or Dimmer item types.
e.g.

```xtend
Group           gBlind   "Blinds"       		         {homekit = "WindowCovering"}
Dimmer          blind_current_position    (gBlind)       {homekit = "CurrentPosition"}
Number          blind_target_position     (gBlind)       {homekit = "TargetPosition"}
String          blind_position            (gBlind)       {homekit = "PositionState"}
```

### Thermostat

A HomeKit thermostat has following mandatory characteristics:

- CurrentTemperature
- TargetTemperature
- CurrentHeatingCoolingMode
- TargetHeatingCoolingMode

In order to define a thermostat you need to create a group with at least these 4 items.
Example:

```xtend
Group  			gThermostat    				"Thermostat"       										 	{homekit = "Thermostat"}
Number 			thermostat_current_temp 	"Thermostat Current Temp [%.1f C]"  	(gThermostat)  		{homekit = "CurrentTemperature"}
Number 			thermostat_target_temp   	"Thermostat Target Temp[%.1f C]" 		(gThermostat) 		{homekit = "TargetTemperature"}  
String 			thermostat_current_mode  	"Thermostat Current Mode" 				(gThermostat)       {homekit = "CurrentHeatingCoolingMode"}          
String 			thermostat_target_mode  	"Thermostat Target Mode" 				(gThermostat)       {homekit = "TargetHeatingCoolingMode"}           
```

In addition, thermostat can have thresholds for cooling and heating modes.
Example with thresholds:

```xtend
Group  			gThermostat    				"Thermostat"       										 	{homekit = "Thermostat"}
Number 			thermostat_current_temp 	"Thermostat Current Temp [%.1f C]"  	(gThermostat)  		{homekit = "CurrentTemperature"}
Number 			thermostat_target_temp   	"Thermostat Target Temp[%.1f C]" 		(gThermostat) 		{homekit = "TargetTemperature"}  
String 			thermostat_current_mode  	"Thermostat Current Mode" 				(gThermostat)       {homekit = "CurrentHeatingCoolingMode"}          
String 			thermostat_target_mode  	"Thermostat Target Mode" 				(gThermostat)       {homekit = "TargetHeatingCoolingMode"}           
Number 			thermostat_cool_thrs 	    "Thermostat Cool Threshold Temp [%.1f C]"  	(gThermostat)  	{homekit = "CoolingThresholdTemperature"}
Number 			thermostat_heat_thrs 	    "Thermostat Heat Threshold Temp [%.1f C]"  	(gThermostat)  	{homekit = "HeatingThresholdTemperature"}
```

#### Min / max temperatures

Current  and target temperatures have default min and max values. Any values below or above max limits will be replaced with min or max limits.
Default limits are:

- current temperature: min value = 0 C, max value = 100 C
- target temperature: min value = 10 C, max value = 38 C

You can overwrite default values using minValue and maxValue configuration at item level, e.g.

```xtend
Number 			thermostat_current_temp 	"Thermostat Current Temp [%.1f C]"  	(gThermostat)  		{homekit = "CurrentTemperature" [minValue=5, maxValue=30]}
Number 			thermostat_target_temp   	"Thermostat Target Temp[%.1f C]" 		(gThermostat) 		{homekit = "TargetTemperature" [minValue=10.5, maxValue=27]} 
```

If "useFahrenheitTemperature" is set to true, the min and max temperature must be provided in Fahrenheit.

#### Thermostat modes

HomeKit thermostat supports following modes

- CurrentHeatingCoolingMode: OFF, HEAT, COOL
- TargetHeatingCoolingMode: OFF, HEAT, COOL, AUTO

These modes are mapped to string values of openHAB items using either global configuration (see [Global Configuration](#Global Configuration)) or configuration at item level.
e.g. if your current mode item can have following values: "OFF", "HEATING", "COOLING" then you need following mapping at item level

```xtend
String 			thermostat_current_mode  	"Thermostat Current Mode" (gThermostat) {homekit = "CurrentHeatingCoolingMode" [OFF="OFF", HEAT="HEATING", COOL="COOLING"]} 
```

You can provide mapping for target mode in similar way.

The custom mapping at item level can be also used to reduce number of modes shown in home app. The modes can be only reduced, but not added, i.e. it is not possible to add new custom mode to HomeKit thermostat.

Example: if your thermostat does not support cooling, then you need to limit mapping  to OFF and HEAT values only:

```xtend
String 			thermostat_current_mode  	"Thermostat Current Mode" 				(gThermostat) {homekit = "CurrentHeatingCoolingMode" [HEAT="HEATING", OFF="OFF"]}          
String 			thermostat_target_mode  	"Thermostat Target Mode" 				(gThermostat) {homekit = "TargetHeatingCoolingMode" [HEAT="HEATING", OFF="OFF"]}
```

The mapping using main UI looks like following:

![mode_mapping.png](doc/mode_mapping.png)

### Valve

The HomeKit valve accessory supports following 2 optional characteristics:

- duration: this describes how long the valve should set "InUse" once it is activated. The duration changes will apply to the next operation. If valve is already active then duration changes have no effect.

- remaining duration: this describes the remaining duration on the valve. Notifications on this characteristic must only be used if the remaining duration increases/decreases from the accessoryʼs usual countdown of remaining duration.

Upon valve activation in home app, home app starts to count down from the "duration" to "0" without contacting the server. Home app also does not trigger any action if it remaining duration get 0.
It is up to valve to have an own timer and stop valve once the timer is over.
Some valves have such timer, e.g. pretty common for sprinklers.
In case the valve has no timer capability, openHAB can take care on this -  start an internal timer and send "Off" command to the valve once the timer is over.

configuration for these two cases looks as follow:

- valve with timer:

```xtend
Group  			gValve    			"Valve Group"       						 	{homekit="Valve"  [homekitValveType="Irrigation"]}
Switch 			valve_active 		"Valve active"				    (gValve) 		{homekit = "Valve.ActiveStatus, Valve.InUseStatus"}
Number 			valve_duration 		"Valve duration" 				(gValve) 		{homekit = "Valve.Duration"}
Number 			valve_remaining_duration "Valve remaining duration" (gValve) 		{homekit = "Valve.RemainingDuration"}
```

- valve without timer (no item for remaining duration required)

```xtend
Group  			gValve    			"Valve Group"       						 	{homekit="Valve"  [homekitValveType="Irrigation", homekitTimer="true]}
Switch 			valve_active 		"Valve active"				    (gValve) 		{homekit = "Valve.ActiveStatus, Valve.InUseStatus"}
Number 			valve_duration 		"Valve duration" 				(gValve) 		{homekit = "Valve.Duration" [homekitDefaultDuration = 1800]}
```

### Sensors

Sensors have typically one mandatory characteristic, e.g. temperature or lead trigger, and several optional characteristics which are typically used for battery powered sensors and/or wireless sensors.
Following table summarizes the optional characteristics supported by sensors.

|  Characteristics             | Supported openHAB items  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:-----------------------------|:-------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                         | String                   | Name of the sensor. This characteristic is interesting only for very specific cases in which the name of accessory is dynamic. if you not sure then you don't need it.                                                   |
| ActiveStatus                 | Switch, Contact          | Accessory current working status. "ON"/"OPEN" indicates that the accessory is active and is functioning without any errors.                                                                                              |
| FaultStatus                  | Switch, Contact          | Accessory fault status. "ON"/"OPEN" value indicates that the accessory has experienced a fault that may be interfering with its intended functionality. A value of "OFF"/"CLOSED" indicates that there is no fault.      |
| TamperedStatus               | Switch, Contact          | Accessory tampered status. "ON"/"OPEN" indicates that the accessory has been tampered. Value should return to "OFF"/"CLOSED" when the accessory has been reset to a non-tampered state.                                  |
| BatteryLowStatus             | Switch, Contact          | Accessory battery status. "ON"/"OPEN" indicates that the battery level of the accessory is low. Value should return to "OFF"/"CLOSED" when the battery charges to a level thats above the low threshold.                 |

Switch and Contact items support inversion of the state mapping, e.g. by default the openHAB switch state "ON" is mapped to HomeKit contact sensor state "Open", and "OFF" to "Closed". 
The configuration "inverted='true'" inverts this mapping, so that "ON" will be mapped to "Closed" and "OFF" to "Open".  

Examples of sensor definitions.

## Additional Notes

HomeKit allows only a single pairing to be established with the bridge.
This pairing is normally shared across devices via iCloud.
If you need to establish a new pairing, you will need to clear the existing pairings.
To do this, you can issue the command `openhab:homekit clearPairings` from the [OSGi console](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/console.html).
After doing this, you may need to remove the file `$OPENHAB_USERDATA/jsondb/homekit.json` and restart openHAB.

HomeKit requires a unique identifier for each accessory advertised by the bridge.
This unique identifier is hashed from the Item's name.
For that reason, it is important that the name of your Items exposed to HomeKit remain consistent.

HomeKit listens by default on port 9124.
Java prefers the IPv6 network stack by default.
If you have connection or detection problems, you can configure Java to prefer the IPv4 network stack instead.
To prefer the IPv4 network stack, adapt the Java command line arguments to include: `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`
Depending on the openHAB installation method, you should modify `start.sh`, `start_debug.sh`, `start.bat`, or `start_debug.bat` (standalone/manual installation) or `EXTRA_JAVA_OPTS` in `/etc/default/openhab2` (Debian installation).

If you encounter any issues with the add-on and need support, it may be important to get detailed logs of your device's communication with openHAB.
In order to get logs from the underlying library used to implement the HomeKit protocol, enable trace logging using the following commands at [the console](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/console.html):

```
openhab> log:set TRACE io.github.hapjava
openhab> log:tail io.github.hapjava
```

In order to enable detailed logs of openHAB HomeKit binding

```
openhab> log:set TRACE org.openhab.io.homekit.internal
openhab> log:tail org.openhab.io.homekit.internal
```

## Console commands

`openhab:homekit list` - list all HomeKit accessories currently advertised to the HomeKit clients.

`openhab:homekit show <accessory_id | name>` - print additional details of the accessories which partially match provided ID or name.

## Troubleshooting 

### openHAB is not listed in home app

if you don't see openHAB in the home app, probably multicast DNS (mDNS) traffic is not routed correctly from openHAB to home app device or openHAB is already in paired state. 
You can verify this with [Discovery DNS iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discovery-dns-sd-browser/id305441017) as follow: 

- install discovery dns app from app store 
- start discovery app
- find `_hap._tcp`  in the list of service types
- if you don't find _hap._tcp on the list, probably the traffic is blocked. 
  - to confirm this, check whether you can find _openhab-server._tcp. if you don't see it as well, traffic is blocked. check your network router/firewall settings.
- if you found _hap._tcp, open it. you should see the name of your openHAB HomeKit bridge (default name is openHAB)

![discovery_hap_list.png](doc/discovery_hap_list.png)  

- if you don't see openHAB bridge name, the traffic is blocked
- if you see openHAB HomeKit bridge, open it

![discovery_openhab_details.png](doc/discovery_openhab_details.png)

- verify the IP address. it must be the IP address of your openHAB server, if not, set the correct IP address using `networkInterface` settings
- verify the flag "sf". 
  - if sf is equal 1, openHAB is accepting pairing from new iOS device. 
  - if sf is equal 0 (as on screenshot), openHAB is already paired and does not accept any new pairing request. you can reset pairing using `openhab:homekit clearPairings` command in karaf console.
- if you see openHAB bridge and sf is equal 1 but you dont see openHAB in home app, probably you home app still think it is already paired with openHAB. remove your home from home app and restart iOS device.
