io.config.hueemulation.createNewUserOnEveryEndpoint.label = Pairing: Add Unknown User-keys
io.config.hueemulation.createNewUserOnEveryEndpoint.description = Set this option to create new users on the fly during the next pairing mode period. This helps with Amazon Echo device discovery. This option is automatically switched off after the timeout.
io.config.hueemulation.discoveryHttpPort.label = Optional Discovery Web Port
io.config.hueemulation.discoveryHttpPort.description = Some Hue applications require a different port (80) then what openHAB runs on by default (8080). This option will only advertise a different port then what we are listening on. Useful if you have an iptables rule redirect traffic from this port to the openHAB port.
io.config.hueemulation.discoveryIp.label = Optional Discovery Address
io.config.hueemulation.discoveryIp.description = If your host has multiple IP addresses you may specify the IP(s) you would like to advertise in the UPNP discovery process. You may safely leave this empty on most systems. Use commas to separate multiple entries.
io.config.hueemulation.ignoreItemsWithTags.label = Ignore Items by Tag
io.config.hueemulation.ignoreItemsWithTags.description = All items that are tagged with the given tags are ignore by the Hue Emulation Service. Use commas to separate multiple entries.
io.config.hueemulation.pairingEnabled.label = Device Pairing
io.config.hueemulation.pairingEnabled.description = Pairing must be enabled to connect a new device. Pairing is automatically disabled after the configured pairing time (usually 60 seconds).
io.config.hueemulation.pairingTimeout.label = Pairing Timeout
io.config.hueemulation.pairingTimeout.description = Pairing is automatically disabled after the given time in seconds.
io.config.hueemulation.permanentV1bridge.label = Permanently Emulate V1 Hue Bridge
io.config.hueemulation.permanentV1bridge.description = There is no obvious reason to not emulate the newer bridge all the time, but here is the option if you want the old (round Hue bridge) to be emulated.
io.config.hueemulation.restrictToTagsColorLights.label = Color Item Tags
io.config.hueemulation.restrictToTagsColorLights.description = The HUE emulation can either publish all Color items if this is set to an empty string or filter items by tags. Use commas to separate multiple entries.
io.config.hueemulation.restrictToTagsSwitches.label = Switch Item Tags
io.config.hueemulation.restrictToTagsSwitches.description = The HUE emulation can either publish Switch items if this is set to an empty string or filter items by tags. Use commas to separate multiple entries.
io.config.hueemulation.restrictToTagsWhiteLights.label = White Item Tags
io.config.hueemulation.restrictToTagsWhiteLights.description = The HUE emulation can either publish all Dimmer items if this is set to an empty string or filter items by tags. Use commas to separate multiple entries.
io.config.hueemulation.temporarilyEmulateV1bridge.label = Pairing: Temporarily Emulate V1 Hue Bridge
io.config.hueemulation.temporarilyEmulateV1bridge.description = Some Amazon Echos only support V1 bridges (round hardware bridge). This option is only active during discovery and automatically switched off after the timeout.
io.config.hueemulation.uuid.label = Unique Bridge ID
io.config.hueemulation.uuid.description = Each Hue bridge has a universal unique id (UUID) assigned. This is random generated if no value has been assigned. Note on Amazon Alexa Echo devices: It might help to change the UUID after you have changed item ids. The Echos will recognize this service as a new bridge.
