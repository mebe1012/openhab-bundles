# Nuki Binding

This is the binding for the [Nuki Smart Lock](https://nuki.io).  
This binding allows you to integrate, view, control and configure the Nuki Bridge, Nuki Smart Lock and Nuki Opener.

## Prerequisites

1. At least one Nuki Smart Lock or Nuki Opener which is paired via Bluetooth with a Nuki Bridge. For this go and get either:
    * [Nuki Smart Lock](https://nuki.io/en/smart-lock/) and a [Nuki Bridge](https://nuki.io/en/bridge/)
    * [Nuki Combo](https://nuki.io/en/shop/nuki-combo/)
2. The Bridge HTTP-API has to be enabled during [Initial Bridge setup](https://nuki.io/en/support/bridge/bridge-setup/initial-bridge-setup/).

It is absolutely recommended to configure static IP addresses for both, the openHAB server and the Nuki Bridge!  

### Nuki Bridge Callback

The Nuki Binding will manage the required callback from the Nuki Bridge to the openHAB server if *manageCallbacks* is set to `true`.
If *manageCallbacks* is not set it will default to `true`.  

If you want to manage the callbacks from the Nuki Bridge to the openHAB server by yourself, you need to set *manageCallbacks* to `false`.
Then add the callback on the Nuki Bridge via Bridge API Endpoint */callback/add* in the format `http://<openHAB_IP>:<openHAB_PORT>/nuki/bcb`.  
The Sheet [NukiBridgeAPI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SGKWhqwqRyOGbv4NEq-8PAPjBORRixvEjRuzO-nVabQ) is a helpfull tool for listing, adding and removing callbacks.  

## Supported Bridges

This binding supports just one bridge type: The Nuki Bridge (`nuki:bridge`). Create one `bridge` per Nuki Bridge available in your home automation environment.  

The following configuration options are available:  

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        | Comment      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| ip              | The IP address of the Nuki Bridge. Look it up on your router. It is recommended to set a static IP address lease for the Nuki Bridge (and for your openHAB server too) on your router.             | Required     |
| port            | The Port which you configured during [Initial Bridge setup](https://nuki.io/en/support/bridge/bridge-setup/initial-bridge-setup/).                                                                 | Default 8080 |
| apiToken        | The API Token which you configured during [Initial Bridge setup](https://nuki.io/en/support/bridge/bridge-setup/initial-bridge-setup/).                                                            | Required     |
| manageCallbacks | Let the Nuki Binding manage the callbacks on the Nuki Bridge. It will add the required callback on the Nuki Bridge. If there are already 3 callbacks, it **will delete** the callback with ID `0`. | Default true |
| secureToken     | Whether hashed token should be used when communicating with Nuki Bridge. If disabled, API token will be sent in plaintext with each request.                                                       | Default true |

### Bridge discovery

Bridges on local network can be discovered automatically if both Nuki Bridge and openHAB have working internet connection. You can check whether discovery
is working by checking [discovery API endpoint](https://api.nuki.io/discover/bridges). To discover bridges do the following:

* In openHAB UI add new thing, select Nuki Binding and start scan. LED on bridge should light up.
* Within 30s press button on Nuki Bridge you want to discover.
* Bridge should appear in inbox.

Pressing bridge button is required for binding to obtain valid API token. If the button isn't pressed during discovery, bridge will
be created but token must be set manually for binding to work.

If bridge is connected to network but not discovered, enter [Manage Bridge](https://support.nuki.io/hc/en-us/articles/360016489018-Manage-Bridge) menu
in Nuki mobile app, check server connection then disconnect and let the bridge restart.

## Supported Things

This binding supports 2 things - Nuki Smart Lock (`nuki:smartlock`) and Nuki Opener (`nuki:opener`). Both devices can be added using discovery after bridge they are 
connected to is configured and online.

### Nuki Smart Lock

The following configuration options are available:

  | Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               | Comment       |
  |-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|

## Troubleshooting

### Bridge and devices are offline with error 403

If secureToken property is enabled, make sure that time on device running openHAB and Nuki Bridge are synchronized. When secureToken
is enabled, all requests contain timestamp and bridge will only accept requests with small time difference. If it is not possible to 
keep time synchronized, disable secureToken feature.

## Full Example

A manual setup through files could look like this:

### things/nuki.things

```
Bridge nuki:bridge:NB1 [ ip="192.168.0.50", port=8080, apiToken="myS3cr3t!", manageCallbacks=true ] {
    Thing smartlock SL1 [ nukiId="12AB89EF", unlatch=false ]
}
```

### items/nuki.items

```

Switch Frontdoor_LowBattery	"Frontdoor Low Battery"		<nukibattery>		{ channel="nuki:smartlock:NB1:SL1:lowBattery" }
Number Frontdoor_DoorState	"Frontdoor (Door State)"	<door>			{ channel="nuki:smartlock:NB1:SL1:doorsensorState" }
```
