# binding

binding.network.name = Network Binding
binding.network.description = The Network Binding can be used for device presence detection and to determine network device health

# binding config

binding.config.network.allowDHCPlisten.label = Listen for DHCP Requests
binding.config.network.allowDHCPlisten.description = Usually a device requests an IP address in an IPv4 network with the help of DHCP as soon as it enters a network. If we listen to those packets, we can detect a device presence even faster. You need elevated access rights (see readme) for this to work.
binding.config.network.allowSystemPings.label = Allow System Pings
binding.config.network.allowSystemPings.description = Allows or disallows to use system pings next to the java integrated ping functionality. On windows the system ping works more reliable most of the time.
binding.config.network.arpPingToolPath.label = ARP Ping Tool Path
binding.config.network.arpPingToolPath.description = If your arp ping tool is not called arping and cannot be found in the PATH environment, you can configure the absolute path / tool name here.
binding.config.network.cacheDeviceStateTimeInMS.label = Cache Time
binding.config.network.cacheDeviceStateTimeInMS.description = The result of a device presence detection is cached for a small amount of time. Be aware that no new pings will be issued within this time frame, even if explicitly requested.
binding.config.network.preferResponseTimeAsLatency.label = Use Response Time as Latency
binding.config.network.preferResponseTimeAsLatency.description = If enabled, an attempt will be made to extract the latency from the output of the ping command. If no such latency value is found in the ping command output, the time to execute the ping command is used as fallback latency. If disabled, the time to execute the ping command is always used as latency value.

# thing types

thing-type.network.pingdevice.label = Pingable Network Device
thing-type.network.pingdevice.description = The presence detection is performed by using ICMP and, if available, ARP pings. You can change the arping tool path in the binding configuration. DHCP sniffing is performed for faster network reentry discovery.
