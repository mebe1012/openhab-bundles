# binding

binding.omnikinverter.name = OmnikInverter Binding
binding.omnikinverter.description = This is the binding for the Omnik solar grid inverters. The integration is based on the undocumented API, which is reverse engineered at https://github.com/Woutrrr/Omnik-Data-Logger. As such, the known supported inverters are known to work with inverters with wifi bridge which start with the serial number '602' and '606'.
