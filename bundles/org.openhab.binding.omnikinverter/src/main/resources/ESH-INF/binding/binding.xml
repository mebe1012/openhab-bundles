	<description>This is the binding for the Omnik solar grid inverters. The integration is based on the
		undocumented API,
		which is reverse engineered at https://github.com/Woutrrr/Omnik-Data-Logger.
		As such, the known supported inverters are
		known to work with inverters with wifi bridge which start with the serial
		number '602' and '606'.
