# Chromecast Binding

The binding integrates Google Chromecast streaming devices.
It not only acts as a typical binding, but also registers each Chromecast device as an audio sink that can be used for playback.

When a Chromecast is used as an audio sink, the Chromecast connects to the runtime to get the audio streams.
The binding sends the Chromecast URLs for getting the audio streams based on the Primary Address (Network Settings configuration) and the runtime HTTP port.
These URL defaults can be overridden with the Callback URL configuration parameter.

This can be configured on the binding level:

| Configuration Parameter | Type | Description                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| callbackUrl             | text | optional Callback URL - url to use for playing notification sounds, e.g. <http://192.168.0.2:8080> |

Configure a Callback URL when the Chromecast cannot connect using the Primary Address or Port, e.g. when:

* proxying HTTP (port 80/443) using Apache/NGINX to openHAB (port 8080)
* openHAB is running inside a Docker container that has its own IP Address

## Supported Things

| Things           | Description                                                                  | Thing Type |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Chromecast       | Classic HDMI video Chromecasts and Google Homes                              | chromecast |
| Chromecast Audio | The Chromecast which only does audio streaming and offers a headphone jack   | audio      |
| Audio Group      | A Chromecast audio group for multi-room audio defined via the Chromecast app | audiogroup |

## Discovery

Chromecast devices are discovered on the network using mDNS.
No authentication is required for accessing the devices on the network.
Auto-discovery is enabled by default.
To disable it, you can add the following line to `<openHAB-conf>/services/runtime.cfg`:

```
discovery.chromecast:background=false
```

## Thing Configuration

Chromecast devices can also be manually added.
The only configuration parameter is the `ipAddress`.
For an audio group also the port is necessary.
The auto-discovery process finds the port automatically.
With manual thing configuration the parameter `port` must be determined manually.

Example for audio group:

```java
Thing chromecast:audiogroup:bathroom  [ ipAddress="192.168.0.23", port=42139]
```
